## Metrics

{% include note.html content="Note that you can make use of this component only if you have provided metrics as a part of the data in the json file. For more details of how to load the data, visit [this page](/ocr_layout.html)" %}

- The user can navigate based on the metrics provided either by ascending or descending order of the mertics. 
- To do so, use the side navigation bar to select by which metric and how the metric should be sorted for navigation.
- In case you have multiple model outputs, the user can also select by which model's metric the sorting should be done.
- In order to view the metrics in the same order as provided in the json data file, choose the metric "None" using the drop down provided for choosing the metrics.
